So, in the middle of this year I started "The quotebook",
A file in my Obsidian vault containing a bunch of quotes from my friends IRL
and a bunch of people online (With permission ofc).
It's a continuation of something my friends started after one of them said this now legendary line:

> “It's a goat, goats are dinosaurs”
> — <cite>04 August 2020 19:02</cite>

Now there are about 108 quotes (and thats only IRL!). Here are some of my favourites from this year (All of these were said in-person. That is the only context you are getting for most of em).

> - [0] What? I have to "draw a cat that represents me"?
> - [1] Wow, that's crazy! I have to do the same thing!
> - [2] Wow that's crazy! I have to do the same thing!
>
> — <cite>23 May 2023</cite>

(numbers represent diff people in the same quote. The same number doesn't nessesarily mean the same person across quotes.)
