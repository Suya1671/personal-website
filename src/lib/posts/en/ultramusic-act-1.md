ULTRAKILL is a game of all time.
You are now legally required to read
me yap about how good the OST is again.
This is a threat.

Also, you will be here for _much_ longer this time,
as we have a total of _counts_ 19 tracks to get through
compared to the 4 in the prelude.

<Note>
If you haven't read the prelude, you should do that first.
Check it out <a href="/posts/ultramusic-prelude">here</a>.

## LAYER 1: LIMBO

### LIMBO /// FIRST: HEART OF THE SUNRISE

#### A Thousand Greetings

Ah yes, the thematic whiplash song.

You're travelling down the elevator to the first real
level of real Hell™ and you're greeted with this.
A lush, outdoor scene, a waterfall, and a _very_ calming
and ambient track to go along.

Honestly it's a pretty soothing track in general,
especially considering the game it's in, similar
to the menu music. It's good for the situation
of just placing down skulls and figuring out
what is going on. However, as you start looking closer
you notice the walls are screens, the music is coming from
speakers, and all of a sudden it's...

#### A Shattered Illusion

Holy the piano motif from a thousand greetings
goes hard here. You're walking through a suspiciously
large hallway and all of a sudden 3 purple lookin drone
things spawn out of nowhere and this starts blasting.
It's perfect for the situation you just got dropped into,
and it's a good way to introduce you to the fact that
you are indeed in Hell™.

### LIMBO /// SECOND: THE BURNING WORLD

This reuses a thousand greetings but a different part
of it that isn't played in the first level. So I'll
only talk about the new part.

#### A Complete and Utter Destruction of the Senses

You're going through the level, killing stuff as usual
while a thousand greetings is playing in the background,
and then you find a hallway. An ear-piercing
noise is playing in the background and you find some husks
that interpreted family BBQ a bit too literally
(they didn't even manage to cook the bodies right smh my head).

Next thing you know, you're in the starting room and everything is on
fire. You find two "streetcleaners", which cleaned the streets
with fire hot enough to make metal burn (this will be important later™).
You no longer have an ear-piercing noise in the background,
you have an ear-piercing song in the foreground. Some people
hate this song, I have it rated 4 stars and favourited on my Navidrome server.
