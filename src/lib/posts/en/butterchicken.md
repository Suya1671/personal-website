        Butter chicken, also known as murgh makhani,
        is a curry made from chicken pieces and a special sauce.
        The sauce is made out of a spices mix, tomatoes, yogurt, and butter.
        It was created by <i>Kundan Lal Gujral</i> in North India,
        initially as a way to prevent Tandoori Chicken from drying out.
        Butter chicken can be eaten on its own, but can also be combined with
        pizzas (It's surprisingly good), samosas, and other foods.

## History

<div class="gap:2 grid-cols:5@md grid-rows:2@<md">
    <p class="grid-col-span:1 grid-col-span:3@md h:min">
        Despite what you may think, butter chicken is young.
        It was made by aforementioned Kundan Lal Gujral in 1948.
        Kundan was a buisness man, and he sold Tandoori Chicken
        (pieces of chicken marinated in spices and yogurt, and cooked over coal).
        He noticed that if not sold, the Tandoori Chicken would dry out quickly.
        He created a solution:
        A basic gravy, with tomatoes, butter, cream, and some spices.
        He then placed the chicken into the sauce, and that kept the moisture in.
        And now, he has created the best chicken to exist.
        <br>
        <br>
        Over time, the recipe has changed slightly and improve upon,
        and it is one of the most popular Indian curries in the world.
        It is now commonly served with roti on the side,
        but you can use it on pizzas, inside of samosas,
        as a pie filling, and possibly more.
